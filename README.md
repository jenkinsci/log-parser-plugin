Parses the console output and highlights error/warning/info lines.  It will make you analyze your build log in a pretty good way in Jenkins
This log parser plugin will parse the console build logs which will be generated by Jenkins build. We can apply the following features in our logs by using this plugin:

* Categorize the build log into the sections like ERRORS, INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, and HEADER.
* Display these sections in summaries like the total number of errors and info on the build page.
* Highlight the lines of our interest in the build log as per our needs.
* Link the summary of errors and warnings with the full log, which makes us easy to search for a line of interest in the build log.
