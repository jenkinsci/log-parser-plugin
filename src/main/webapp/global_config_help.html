    Configure pairs of logical names (project) and parsing rule files.
    Later on, when a job is configured for log parsing, you will be able to choose one of these configurations to implement as the parsing rules for that job.
    <br/><br/>
    For each parsing rules option, specify:
    <ul>
      <li>Description - logical name which will be displayed in the job level configuration as an option</li>
      <li>Parsing Rules File - file with the parsing rules implemented in this option</li>
    </ul>
